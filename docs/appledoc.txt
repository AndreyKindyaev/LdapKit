LDAP Kit is a framework which provides an Objective-C interface for the
[OpenLDAP](http://www.openldap.org/) client libraries on Max OS X and iOS. LDAP
Kit manages the conversion between C data types and Objective-C classes, manages
background threads for executing LDAP tasks, and manages memory allocated by
OpenLDAP via NSAutoreleasePool objects.

The LDAP Kit [Project Information](docs/LDAP%20Kit%20Project%20Information.html)
page contains basic instructions for integrating LDAP Kit into iOS and Mac OS X
applications.  The source code for [LDAP Kit](https://github.com/bindle/LdapKit/) and this
[documentation](http://bindle.github.com/LdapKit/) are available for download
from [Github](https://github.com/).
